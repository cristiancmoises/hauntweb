### Liberating. 
Guix is a distribution of the GNU operating system developed by the GNU Projectâ€”which respects the freedom of computer users.

### Dependable. 
Guix supports transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management, and more. When used as a standalone distribution, Guix supports declarative system configuration for transparent and reproducible operating systems.

### Hackable. 
It provides Guile Scheme APIs, including high-level embedded domain-specific languages (EDSLs) to define packages and whole-system configurations.
